# HW01  
I have completed items 1-6 for this assignment.  
  
### etchASketch.py  
This file runs an etch-a-sketch type program in the console. The program will ask the user to specify the heigth and width of the board.
After that the board will be displayed. An X will note where the board has been filled. The user will be prompted for a command. The following list
explains each command:  
- up: moves the cursor up and fills in the spot with an X  
- down: moves the cursor down and fills the spot with an X  
- right: moves the cursor right and fills in the spot with an X  
- left: moves the cursor left and fills the spot with an X  
- clear: clears the whole board  

## Prof. Yoder's comments

Everything looks good.  Etch-a-sketch works, but a bit awkward having to type the whole name.
